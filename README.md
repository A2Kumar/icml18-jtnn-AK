# Fast jtnn


This is the accelerated implementation of our Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder [https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04364](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04364)

# Quick Start
This repository contains the following directories:
* `molvae/` includes scripts for training our VAE model. Please read `molvae/README.md` for training our VAE model.
* `fast_jtnn/` contains codes for model formulation.
